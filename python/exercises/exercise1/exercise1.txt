Write a program in Python that asks the user to enter a string, and return him a dictionary whose
keys are the characters in the string entered and the values are the number of occurrences of the characters in the string. 
Example if the entered string is s = 'language', the program returns the dictionary:

d = {'l': 1, 'a': 2, 'n': 1, 'g': 2, 'e': 1}
